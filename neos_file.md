If you use the "Open in Cloud Shell" link in the README, this file should open in the Cloud Shell UI. Let's see how code blocks render...

### Code block with backticks, no language specified

    ```
    echo 'hello'
    ```

### Code block with backticks, 'bash' language specified

    ```bash
    echo 'hello'
    ```

### Indented code block (no backticks)

    echo 'hello'

### Code block with tildes

    ~~~
    echo 'hello'
    ~~~
